# FoodSeg103: Fine-Tuning Mask2Former for Semantic Segmentation üçîüçï

## Project Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning the Mask2Former model for semantic segmentation specifically on the **FoodSeg103** dataset. The goal was to enhance the model's performance in identifying and segmenting various food items from images. The project also includes deploying the fine-tuned model and creating a user-friendly GUI with Gradio for interactive inference.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NimaVahdat/FoodSeg_mask2former.git
   cd FoodSeg_mask2former
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Configuration

Configure the training parameters in the `config.yaml` file:

- `batch_size`: Number of samples per batch.
- `learning_rate`: Initial learning rate for the optimizer.
- `step_size`: Epoch interval for learning rate adjustment.
- `gamma`: Factor for learning rate decay.
- `epochs`: Total number of training epochs.
- `save_path`: Directory to save model checkpoints.
- `load_checkpoint`: Path to a pre-trained checkpoint (or `None` to train from scratch).
- `log_dir`: Directory for TensorBoard logs.

### Training

To start the training process, execute:
```bash
python  -m scripts.run_training
```
This command will initialize training based on the parameters specified in `config.yaml` and save the trained model checkpoints to the specified `save_path`.

### Model Deployment with Gradio

Deploy the model using Gradio to create an interactive web interface that allows users to upload images and view segmentation results in real time.

1. **Run the Gradio App:**
   ```bash
   python -m gradio_app.app
   ```

2. **Access the Interface:**
   Open your browser and go to the URL provided in the terminal to start interacting with the model.

## Model and Dataset

### Mask2Former Model
- **Mask2Former** is a state-of-the-art model designed for instance and semantic segmentation tasks. It leverages transformer-based architecture to provide accurate and robust segmentation results.
- In this project, Mask2Former was fine-tuned on the FoodSeg103 dataset to adapt its capabilities for food-related segmentation tasks.

### FoodSeg103 Dataset
- [**FoodSeg103**](https://huggingface.co/datasets/EduardoPacheco/FoodSeg103) is a comprehensive semantic segmentation dataset containing 103 food categories. It provides diverse and annotated food images to train and evaluate segmentation models.

## Results

- **Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)**: Achieved a mIoU score of **4.21** on the validation set. The model's performance could be further improved with enhanced computing resources and longer fine-tuning periods.
